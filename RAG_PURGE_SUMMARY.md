# RAG System Purge - Summary

## Completed on June 20, 2025

### Files Removed
- `app/utils/local_rag.py` - Main RAG service implementation
- `app/ai/routes/rag.py` - RAG API endpoints
- `app/utils/query_processor.py` - RAG query processing
- `app/templates/ai/vectorize_documents.html` - Vectorization UI
- `app/ai/routes/chat_new.py` - Incomplete experimental chat file
- `reference_books/` directory - Vector store and reference books
- `scripts/rag_manager.py` - RAG management CLI
- `scripts/vectorize_references.py` - Vectorization script
- `scripts/run_vectorization.sh` - Interactive vectorization script
- `scripts/README.md` - RAG-focused documentation
- `docs/DOCUMENTATION.md` - Heavily RAG-focused documentation
- `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` - RAG-focused project summary

### Dependencies Removed from pyproject.toml
- `chromadb>=1.0.13` - Vector database
- `langchain>=0.3.25` - LLM framework
- `langchain-community>=0.3.25` - LangChain community extensions
- `langchain-openai>=0.3.24` - LangChain OpenAI integration
- `sentence-transformers>=3.0.0` - Text embeddings
- `transformers>=4.40.0` - HuggingFace transformers
- `torch>=2.0.0` - PyTorch ML framework

### Code Changes
- **app/ai/routes/chat.py**: Replaced RAG query processing with direct web search
- **app/ai/summarization.py**: Removed RAG enhancement functions, replaced with web search
- **app/records/routes/dashboard.py**: Removed RAG status checking
- **app/templates/records/dashboard.html**: Removed entire RAG section from dashboard
- **app/static/js/dashboard.js**: Removed RAG-related JavaScript functions
- **app/__init__.py**: Removed RAG blueprint registration
- **start_phrm.py**: Updated startup status to reflect RAG removal
- **README.md**: Removed RAG setup instructions

### Functionality Preserved
- ✅ AI chat with web search enhancement
- ✅ Health record summarization with web context
- ✅ All core PHRM functionality
- ✅ PDF processing for health records (kept PyMuPDF)
- ✅ Web search for medical information
- ✅ Citation system (now web-only)

### Benefits Achieved
- **Reduced Dependencies**: Removed ~70 heavy ML/AI packages
- **Faster Installation**: No more large PyTorch/transformer downloads
- **Simpler Architecture**: No vector database complexity
- **Cleaner Codebase**: Removed ~3000+ lines of RAG-related code
- **Real-time Information**: Web search provides current medical info vs static books
- **Lower Memory Usage**: No large ML models loaded in memory

### Impact on AI Features
- Chat responses still enhanced with web search
- Medical summaries still get external context
- Citations now from trusted medical websites
- No local book references, but more up-to-date information

The application is now significantly lighter and more focused on core health record management with web-enhanced AI features.
