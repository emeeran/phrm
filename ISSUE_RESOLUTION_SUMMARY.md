# Issue Resolution Summary (June 17, 2025)

## 1. Added Favicon

- Created a new favicon.ico file in `/app/static/favicon.ico`
- This should resolve the 404 error for `/favicon.ico`

## 2. Fixed MedGemma Inference API 402 Error (Quota Exhaustion)

### Configuration Updates:
- Modified `.env.production` file to include a placeholders for new Hugging Face tokens
- Added an `HF_TOKEN_STATUS` variable to track token status
- Added better error handling for quota exhaustion in `app/utils/ai_helpers.py`
- Added fallback model support when MedGemma quota is exhausted

### Code Improvements:
- Enhanced error messages to indicate quota exhaustion clearly
- Added fallback mechanism to use alternative models when MedGemma is unavailable
- Updated `_generate_fallback_response()` to give better technical context about the issue

### Documentation:
- Created a new `API_TOKEN_MANAGEMENT.md` guide for managing API tokens
- Documented the process to obtain and update Hugging Face tokens

## 3. Python-dotenv Integration

- Added code to load environment variables from `.env.production` in `start_phrm.py`
- Confirmed `python-dotenv` is already included in `pyproject.toml` dependencies

## 4. User Experience Improvements

- Added clear warning messages during application startup if HF token is missing or expired
- Added guidance for administrators to update tokens
- Enhanced error messages in the chat interface when all AI providers fail

## Next Steps

1. **Token Management**:
   - Update the `.env.production` file with a fresh Hugging Face token
   - Consider rotating between multiple accounts or upgrading to PRO

2. **Alternative Model Exploration**:
   - Consider using self-hosted models to avoid API quota limitations
   - Evaluate additional model providers like Claude or Anthropic

3. **Monitoring**:
   - Set up a monitoring system to track API usage and alert before quotas are exhausted
   - Consider implementing a token rotation system
