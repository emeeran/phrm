## 1. Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive Personal Health Record Manager (PHRM) designed to empower users with the ability to securely store, manage, and understand their health data. It provides a user-friendly web interface for managing personal and family health records, including medical conditions, medications, and appointments.

A key feature of this application is its powerful AI-driven assistant. This assistant can answer medical questions, summarize uploaded health documents (such as PDFs), and provide symptom-checking capabilities. The system is designed to be robust, with support for multiple AI providers and intelligent fallback mechanisms to ensure high availability.

## 2. Tech Stack

The PHRM application is built on a modern, robust, and scalable technology stack:

**Backend:**

*   **Framework:** Flask

*   **Authentication:** Flask-Login for session management
*   **API & Schema Validation:** WTForms and Pydantic
*   **Asynchronous Tasks:** Gevent for concurrent operations
*   **Caching:** Redis for improved performance (with in-memory fallback)

**Frontend:**

*   **Templating:** Jinja2
*   **JavaScript:** Vanilla JavaScript for dynamic features
*   **CSS:** Custom stylesheets with a modern UI design

DEEPSEEK_API_KEY=sk-...

# Web Search Enhancement
SERPER_API_KEY=your_serper_api_key

# Optional AI Providers
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...

# Flask Configuration
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
FLASK_ENV=development
```

### 4. Set Up the Database

This command initializes the database and populates it with sample data.

```bash
python setup_database.py
```

### 5. Start the Application

```bash
# Using the Makefile (recommended)
make run

# Or manually
python start_phrm.py
```

### 6. Performance Monitoring (NEW)

The application now includes comprehensive performance monitoring tools:

```bash
# View current performance statistics
flask performance stats

# Real-time performance monitoring
flask performance monitor

# Generate performance report
flask performance report

# Clear cache entries
flask performance clear-cache

# Run automatic optimizations
flask performance optimize
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

## 4. Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directories:

```
phrm/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                    # Main application package
