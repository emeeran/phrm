member_filter = request.args.get('member', 'all')

# Consolidated data aggregation
if member_filter == 'all':
    # Combine user + family data
elif member_filter == 'self':
    # Only user's data
else:
    # Specific family member's data

# Pass selected_member to template for profile card
selected_member = next((fm for fm in family_members if str(fm.id) == member_filter), None)
```

### 2. Frontend Changes (`app/templates/records/dashboard.html`)
