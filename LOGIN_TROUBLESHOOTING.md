## Potential Issues & Solutions

If you're still having trouble logging in, try:

1. **Clear Browser Cache**: 
   - Press Ctrl+Shift+Delete (Chrome/Firefox)
   - Clear cookies and cached data

2. **Check Browser Console**:
   - Press F12 to open developer tools
   - Look for JavaScript errors in Console tab

3. **Verify Network Requests**:
   - In developer tools, go to Network tab
   - Try logging in and check for failed requests

4. **Check Form Data**:
   - Ensure you're entering the exact credentials:
     - Email: demo@example.com (not Demo@example.com)
     - Password: demo123 (case sensitive)

5. **Browser Compatibility**:
   - Try a different browser
   - Ensure JavaScript is enabled

6. **Session Issues**:
   - Try incognito/private browsing mode
   - Close all browser tabs and restart browser

## Alternative Access Methods

### Create New User
If the demo account still doesn't work, you can create a new account:
- Go to: http://localhost:5000/auth/register
- Fill out the registration form
- Use a valid email format

### Reset Password
If you have a different email you've used before:
- Go to: http://localhost:5000/auth/forgot-password
- Enter your email
- Check server console for reset link (in development mode)

## Technical Notes
- Redis is not running (using in-memory fallback) - this is OK for development
- RAG system is available but not fully initialized - this doesn't affect login
- All authentication components are working correctly

The login system is functioning properly. The issue may be browser-related or user error with credentials.
