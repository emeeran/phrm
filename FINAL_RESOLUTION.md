# PHRM - RESOLUTION COMPLETE ✅

## Final Status: FULLY RESOLVED AND PRODUCTION READY

**Date:** June 14, 2025
**Branch:** `main`
**Latest Commits:**
- `386e4ac` - fix: Update templates to match streamlined form fields
- `48867c6` - refactor: Streamline and declutter PHRM application

---

## ✅ ALL ISSUES RESOLVED

### **1. SQLAlchemy Error** ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `Entity namespace for "family_members" has no property "user_id"`
**Solution:** Fixed FamilyMember relationship queries to use proper many-to-many relationship through `user_family` table

### **2. Jinja Template Error** ✅ FIXED
**Error:** `'RecordForm object' has no attribute 'investigations'`
**Solution:** Updated all templates to remove references to streamlined-out form fields

### **3. Application Streamlining** ✅ COMPLETE
**Objective:** Declutter and streamline the PHRM application
**Achievement:** Successfully reduced complexity while maintaining full functionality
