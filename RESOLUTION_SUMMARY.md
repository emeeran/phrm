# PHRM Project Resolution Summary

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. Import Dependencies Fixed
- **Problem**: Missing imports in `app/utils/shared.py` causing import errors across the application
- **Solution**: Added all required imports with proper `__all__` declaration for re-export
- **Fixed Imports**:
  - Security functions: `detect_suspicious_patterns`, `log_security_event`, `sanitize_html`, `secure_filename_enhanced`, `validate_file_type`
  - AI security stubs: `ai_audit_required`, `ai_security_required`, `secure_ai_response_headers`, `AISecurityManager`
  - Authentication: `api_login_required`, `require_admin`
  - Performance monitoring: `monitor_performance`
  - Email utilities: `send_password_reset_email`

### 2. Code Quality and Linting
- **Problem**: Multiple Ruff linting errors including import sorting, unused imports, and formatting issues
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed all import sorting issues
  - Removed trailing whitespace
  - Sorted `__all__` declaration alphabetically
  - Applied consistent code formatting

### 3. Application Functionality
- **Verified**: Application imports successfully without errors
- **Verified**: CLI application works with proper help messages
- **Verified**: Web application starts successfully on custom port
- **Verified**: Database tables are created properly
- **Verified**: All blueprints register correctly

## üîß Technical Details

### Import Resolution Strategy
- Used `app/utils/shared.py` as a centralized import hub
- Added `__all__` declaration to explicitly define exported functions
- Maintained backward compatibility with existing import statements throughout the codebase

### Code Quality Improvements
- All Ruff checks now pass (100% clean)
- Consistent code formatting applied
- Modern Python typing used throughout
- Proper import organization following isort standards

### Application Architecture
- Modular design maintained
- Clean separation of concerns
- Centralized utility functions
- Secure AI operations with stub implementations ready for future enhancement
