# PHRM System - Resolution Complete ‚úÖ

## Issues Resolved

### üîß Database Schema Mismatch
**Problem:** The application was trying to query new columns (`appointment_type`, `doctor_specialty`, etc.) that didn't exist in the database.

**Solution:**
- Created proper database migration: `enhance_health_records_001`
- Added 17 new columns to `health_records` table
- Applied migration successfully with `flask db upgrade`

### üìä Database Structure Now Complete

#### New `health_records` Table Fields:
```sql
-- Enhanced doctor visit tracking fields
appointment_type VARCHAR(100)
doctor_specialty VARCHAR(100)
clinic_hospital VARCHAR(200)
visit_duration INTEGER

cost FLOAT
